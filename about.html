                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2018 by a group of passionate environmental science students from the University of Cape Town, Green Futures Initiative began as a response to the growing disconnect between urban youth and their natural environment.</p>
                
                <p>What started as a weekend volunteer project at three local schools has blossomed into a movement spanning 50+ schools across the Western Cape. Our founders recognized that many children in under-resourced communities had limited access to practical environmental education and fresh, nutritious food.</p>

                <p>Today, we continue to grow, driven by our belief that every child deserves the opportunity to connect with nature and learn skills that will sustain them for life.</p>
